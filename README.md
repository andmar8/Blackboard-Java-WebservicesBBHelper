Blackboard-Java-WebservicesBBHelper
===================================

Bare with me, it'll take a while to get all the required source and dependancies on github and then a bit of documentation to make this useful...

Documentation can still be found in the project's original home on oscelot... http://projects.oscelot.org/gf/project/webservices/, this will change "at some point in the future"

This project is essentially a series of "helpers" that allows you to deal with the blackboard API using only POJO's NOT blackboard objects, the code abstracts that away, the immediate advantage of this approach is the interface used to talk to the blackboard API can serialize the objects :)

Dependencies
------------

* Blackboard jar files (remember to NOT compile these into your jar!)
* [Blackboard-Java-WebservicesBBSerializableObjects](https://github.com/andmar8/Blackboard-Java-WebservicesBBSerializableObjects)

How to compile
--------------

Create/find jars for all of the above and add to your project
